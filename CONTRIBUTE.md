## Guidelines
ThinAër was created to remove the complexities and reduce the overall size of the required packet. For that reason, only the option bytes can be altered by external contributors. Cases can be presented via a GitHub issue to alter the primary advertising packet. Primary advertising packet cases take a review and can take a few weeks to accept or reject a proposed change, please be a thorough as possible when making this type of request.


* Check the branch `draft` before making the request, another contributor may have already done the work. It’s also good practice to look through the GitHub issues to see if other users have the same need.
* No changes to the primary advertising packet will be accepted through a pull request unless approved beforehand.
* Changes must be well documented and cover a larger use case then just your own.
* Changes may only take place in the option bytes, such as a new key and value type to be included.


Before considering a change, please ask any questions you may have so that we may help you complete your project goal.
